# Murphy: Journey of a Builder

Murphy's Law states: "Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong."
Just like building a startup or launching a product—full of risks but as exciting as exploring the universe, venturing into black holes, or reaching for the unknown.

But like explorers and scientists, Web3 builders don't waste time. Each failure, each attempt contributes to accumulated experience—bringing us closer to breakthroughs, to visionaries like Elon Musk or companies like Tesla.

In Web3, we're also building rockets—not to fly to Mars, but to advance into a decentralized future.
I've chosen to become a builder—like a farmer nurturing crops, a teacher passing on valuable knowledge, an astronaut exploring new territories. Each morning when I wake up, I know who I am and what I want to do.

I've failed many times—and it's precisely these failures that helped me win hackathons and meet incredible people. That's why I want to create Murphy—an SDK that helps you easily approach Web3 and Solana in your own way.

So don't fear failure. If you don't dare to try, others will try, fail, and learn faster than you. And you'll end up learning from them.

Can we change Murphy's Law?

Haha... No.

But if anything happens on Solana—
let Murphy be the one to define it.
