          Murphy: A Builder's Journey

            Murphy's Law states: "Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong." It's
            just like building a startup or launching a product — full of risks
            but as exciting as exploring the universe, entering black holes, or
            reaching for the unknown.

          <p className="mb-6">
            But like explorers or scientists, Web3 builders don't waste time.
            Each failure, each attempt contributes to accumulated experience —
            bringing us closer to breakthroughs, to people like Elon Musk or
            companies like Tesla.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            In Web3, we're also building rockets — not to fly to Mars, but to
            advance into a decentralized future. And I choose to be a builder —
            like a farmer tending to crops, a teacher passing on valuable
            knowledge, an astronaut exploring new territories. Each morning when
            I wake up, I know who I am and what I want to do.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            I've failed many times — and that's exactly what helped me win
            hackathons and meet amazing people. That's why I want to create
            Murphy — an SDK that helps you easily approach Web3 and Solana in
            your own way.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            So don't be afraid to fail. If you don't try, someone else will,
            they'll fail, they'll learn faster than you. And you'll end up
            learning from them.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">Can we change Murphy's Law?</p>

          <p className="mb-6">Haha... No.</p>

          <p className="mb-6 font-semibold">
            But if anything is going to happen on Solana —<br />
            let Murphy be the one to define it.
